The Czech neutron community meeting 2024 continues the series of annual meetings of Czech neutron users started in 2016 and informal meetings of neutron users NeutronBeer, which were interrupted by the covid-19 pandemic.

The meeting aims to:

 1. inform the community about neutron facilities, memberships of the Czech Republic in international associations and related opportunities,
 2. overview the methods and experimental techniques using neutrons for the study of a broad spectrum of materials and phenomena,
 3. encourage networking among users from different institutes and universities in the Czech Republic,
 4. discuss the establishment of neutron community in the Czech Republic.

Subsequent meetings in the following years will be more dedicated, focussing only on several selected problematics, related methods and opportunities. The colleagues from research institutes and facilities abroad will be invited to share their results and suggest collaborations on the respective topics.
